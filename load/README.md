Load
====

This program connects in parallel to a bunch of hosts, query the load average and print it with colors.

It can help to have a whole vision of the load of your servers.

You will need the following python modules:

 - Paramiko
 - Argparse

Other modules should be included by default on regular distros.

Config file (load.conf) should be saved to ~/.load.conf

Every parameter in the config file can be overwritten using command line parameters.
